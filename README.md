# Portfolio
## Description
My personal professional portfolio detailing all of my live programs and webpages that I have created. The displayed projects highlight my experience with using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a new student to coding, I have been challenged with learning a new field of study and the skillset that comes with front and back end application and web development. Over time I will come back to update my applications and webpages so that they are more concise and professionally put together.
